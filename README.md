The green color pallet indicates that the equipment is presently running. Red indicates breakdown, orange indicates maintenance and grey indicates that the equipment is idle. A remark is also displayed which provides additional information like breakdown detail if the equipment is under breakdown. 

More information is present on the back side of the pallet which can be revealed by tapping or hovering the pointer over it.

The back end (server side) is an apache server running PHP and MySQL on a Linux machine. While the front end (client-side) has been made with HTML, CSS and Javascript. 
The server-client data exchange can happen asynchronously over XHR. The format of data exchange is JSON.
